# ðŸŽ¬ SUPER PREMIUM MOVIE WEBSITE - Copilot Instructions

## Project Overview

This is a SUPER PREMIUM and UNIQUE movie website built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and DaisyUI. The goal is to create the most innovative and immersive movie experience on the web.

## Architecture & Technology Stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Data Fetching**: TanStack React Query
- **Animations**: Framer Motion
- **3D Graphics**: Three.js with React Three Fiber
- **API**: TMDB (The Movie Database)
- **Icons**: Lucide React + Heroicons

## Coding Standards & Best Practices

### TypeScript

- Use strict TypeScript with proper type definitions
- Create comprehensive interfaces for all API responses
- Prefer type over interface for simple types
- Use proper generic types for reusable components

### Component Architecture

- Use functional components with hooks
- Implement proper error boundaries
- Create reusable UI components in `/components/ui`
- Use compound component patterns for complex UI
- Implement proper loading states and skeletons

### State Management

- Use Zustand for global state (theme, user preferences, etc.)
- Use React Query for server state and caching
- Keep local state minimal with useState/useReducer
- Implement proper state persistence where needed

### Styling Guidelines

- Use DaisyUI components as the foundation
- Implement custom themes with CSS variables
- Create responsive designs mobile-first
- Use semantic color tokens
- Implement dark/light mode support
- Add smooth transitions and micro-interactions

### Performance

- Implement proper code splitting and lazy loading
- Use React.memo for expensive components
- Optimize images with Next.js Image component
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Use Intersection Observer for infinite scroll

### Premium Features to Implement

- 3D movie poster animations
- AI-powered movie recommendations
- Voice search capabilities
- Immersive theater mode
- Social features (watch parties, reviews)
- AR/VR preview experiences
- Real-time statistics and analytics
- Advanced filtering and search
- Personalized dashboards
